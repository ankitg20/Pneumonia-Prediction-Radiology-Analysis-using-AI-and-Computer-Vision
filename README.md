# Pneumonia Prediction Radiology Analysis using AI and Computer Vision
## By: Ankit Gupta
I trained a machine learning model using Tensorflow and Keras on Radiology Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detection from the Mendeley Dataset's validated OCT and Chest X-Ray data (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2) for treating human diseases.

I conducted this AI/Computer Vision Research remotely for 2 hours a week over the duration of mid-December 2019 to late March 2020. I configured the dataset, engineered the machine learning model, and evaluated the accuracy metrics on the data.

I contacted Dr. Daniel Rubin of Stanford University in early December about this research area of using AI for radiology image analysis, and have continued working on this research remotely into January, February, and March. I plan to continue collaborating with Dr. Rubin remotely into the summer and Fall of 2020, when I will prospectively transition to researching in-person at Stanford.
